## Measures

I take the following measures to ensure accessibility of this site:

- Include accessibility as a core part of development.
- Audit each page with [axe-core](https://github.com/dequelabs/axe-core) via Playwright across multiple viewports.
- Use semantic HTML, visible focus indicators, and keyboard navigation throughout.
- Respect `prefers-reduced-motion` in all animations and interactions.

## Conformance

This site targets conformance with [WCAG 2.2 Level AA](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG22/). It is partially conformant, meaning some parts may not fully meet the standard.

- The third-party comment widget (Giscus) is excluded from audits and may have its own gaps.
- Screen reader testing with NVDA, JAWS, or VoiceOver hasn't yet been performed.

## Feedback

If you encounter a barrier on this site, please [open an issue on GitHub](https://github.com/steelesh/steelesh.dev/issues).
