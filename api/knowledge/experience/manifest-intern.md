As a Frontend Developer Intern at Manifest (Jul — Sep 2025), Steele rebuilt a 50+ page B2C web application from Figma specifications. He created a shared component library that is used across multiple Manifest products, establishing consistent design patterns and reusable UI elements. The tech stack included React, TypeScript, and CSS. This internship demonstrated his ability to translate design specs into production code at scale, and led to a full-time offer as a Backend Software Engineer.
