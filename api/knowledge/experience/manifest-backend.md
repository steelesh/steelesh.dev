As a Software Engineer at Manifest (Oct 2025 — Present), Steele collaborates with cross-functional teams to ship features and fix bugs across the product suite, improving usability, maintainability, and supporting Manifest's mission to simplify retirement account rollovers. He works primarily with Spring Boot, AWS, and TypeScript. He started as a Frontend Developer Intern (Jul — Sep 2025), where he rebuilt a 50+ page B2C web application from Figma specifications with a focus on responsive design, accessibility, and user experience, and created a shared component library used across multiple Manifest products. This led to a full-time offer as a Software Engineer.
