## A Technical Decision He's Proud Of

He recommended migrating a client's website from a DigitalOcean droplet with Cloudflare to managed WordPress hosting on WPEngine. It simplified the infrastructure, improved performance, and made their workflow way easier. The client is moving faster now with less headache. That's the kind of decision he likes making — pragmatic improvements that make a real difference.

## Lessons From Mistakes

He's taken down development environments more than once. Each time he learned something new and put guards in place to prevent the same thing from happening again. His takeaway: breaking things is how you learn what to protect.

## Non-Negotiable Practices

- Conventional commits on every project
- Always have a linter and formatter configured
- A solid README
- OpenAPI specs for any API work

These keep things consistent and make it easier for anyone to jump in.

## Technologies He's Excited About

- **Building with LLMs and AI APIs** — using Claude, OpenAI, and other AI APIs to build intelligent features and tools
- **AI agents & automation** — autonomous agents that handle multi-step tasks and coding workflows
- **AI-powered developer tooling** — building dev tools that leverage AI
- **Edge computing** — serverless at the edge with Cloudflare Workers
- **AWS & cloud infrastructure** — building and managing cloud systems
- **Svelte/SvelteKit** — modern frontend framework
- **Docker** — containerization

He's deep into AI — both using it to build better tools and building products powered by it.

## Production Systems Experience

He's worked with AWS alerts for monitoring production systems. He understands the importance of knowing when something breaks before users do.
