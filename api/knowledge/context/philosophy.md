## Engineering Philosophy

Steele believes in getting things right the first time with clean, readable code that follows the language's conventions. He'd rather use good tools that already exist than build from scratch, and he'd rather prevent problems than fix them.

## What "Good Code" Means

Good code is code that a new developer can read, understand, and build on without needing a walkthrough. That means clean naming, short focused functions, no linter errors, and proper abstraction. If someone has to squint to figure out what's going on, it needs to be rewritten.

## How He Chooses Tools

He figures out what needs to be done and how it needs to perform, then picks the best established tool for the job. He sticks with well-known, proven technologies and doesn't chase the newest thing just because it's new.

## Problems He Enjoys Solving

- Designing how systems fit together
- Building tools that make developers' lives easier
- Making the user experience feel right
- Refactoring messy or outdated codebases into something clean and maintainable
- Automating anything that shouldn't be done by hand

## Learning Approach

He starts with the docs to understand how something is meant to be used, then builds with it. If he hits something specific or needs to go deeper, he reads more targeted material. He learns best by doing but likes to have a solid foundation first.
