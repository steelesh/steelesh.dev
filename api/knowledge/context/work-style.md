## Team Environment

Steele thrives on small teams with clear structure and process. He prefers a hybrid setup — in-person time for collaboration and heads-down focus time at home.

## Collaboration Style

He prefers async communication so people have time to think before responding. He likes being involved in product decisions, especially anything that touches the user experience. He cares a lot about how things look and feel, not just how they work.

## Handling Disagreements

He speaks up honestly but respectfully. If he thinks there's a better approach, he'll say so and explain why. He's also been wrong plenty of times — when that happens, he owns it, learns from it, and moves on.

## Development Workflow

Feature branches with PRs and code reviews. CI/CD is a must. He likes to automate as much as possible: tests, deployments, whatever makes sense. He's also interested in using AI tools to help with review and automation. He doesn't see much benefit in pair programming.

## What He's Looking For

Growth, fair compensation, and a team culture where people actually care about what they're building. He likes challenging problems and wants to work on something that genuinely improves people's lives. He wants to avoid teams that are stuck in their ways and resistant to adopting modern tools and practices.
